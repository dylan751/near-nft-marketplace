## How to run Smart Contract

## Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)

## Step 1: Create an account for the contract

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `todo-app.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `todo-app.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

   near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

   near create-account todo-app.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

## Step 2: set contract name in code

NFT Marketplace Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`. You can compile it with
   the `./compile` script.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.
